## üî• Key Observations:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)** consistently outperforms others in both **Accuracy (~76%)** and **ROC-AUC (0.66)**.
- **Random Forest (RF)** and **KNN** models show competitive results with good balance between accuracy and ROC-AUC.
- **SVM, XGBoost, GBDT** models currently underperform (ROC-AUC ~0.50), indicating potential areas for hyperparameter tuning or feature engineering.
- Decision Tree shows moderate results but can overfit without pruning or tuning.

## üöÄ Future Improvements:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for models like SVM, GBDT, and XGBoost.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Explore interaction features, normalization, or removing irrelevant features.
3. **Ensemble Techniques:**
   - Combine multiple models using stacking or voting classifiers for improved performance.
4. **Handling Class Imbalance:**
   - Apply SMOTE or other resampling techniques if the dataset is imbalanced.
5. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Use k-fold cross-validation for a more generalized evaluation.
